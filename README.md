# A shift to Save the Boys?
Air SST TSP Relationship in Nesting Loggerhead Turtles
Code to accompany manuscript A phenological shift to save the boys? Current and projected trends of hatchling sex ratio of the loggerhead turtle Caretta caretta at Dalyan Beach, TÃ¼rkiye, Kirkham et al 2025

These are simply a series of scripts to first correlate environmental variables with nest temperature loggers, interpolate over a year, apply the Hill equation to estimate Sex ratio, then project ratios into future.

All data was collected at Dalyan Beach, Turkey by DEKAMER

Air temperature data was downloaded from www.visualcrossing.com

Download this and the run the SST scripts first. Then the complete analysis.R should run provided you have the files I have. Otherwise you will need to do some renaming. Most of the workflow is in automated loops so that you _should_ only need to run the code one. 

If you have any questions about how this code works, the data was collected or how to process similar data please reach out
